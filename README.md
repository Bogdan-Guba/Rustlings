# Rustlings Solutions

This repository contains my completed solutions to the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises — a series of small coding tasks designed to teach the Rust programming language through practice.

Each exercise has been solved and compiled successfully. This repo serves as a personal reference and may help others learning Rust.

To get started with Rustlings yourself, check out the [official repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).
